# Introduction

In Touch is a Skillsme Hackathon project with the main goal of helping the elderly connect to 
mutual aid groups using their preexisting phone line. 

This project is a ready-to-use open-source template for mutual aid groups to set up an IVR and the 
required interface to operate it. The project is designed to be easy to customise and get started 
on.

## Twilio

[Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) is a cloud-based communication API for SMS, voice and messaging applications. In Touch uses [Twilioâ€™s 
Voice API](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice) to create a seamless integration with a real phone number.

A Twilio account and phone number is required to get In Touch working. Check [Twilio Setup](/getting-started/twilio) for more information.
